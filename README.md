This repositry contains the example code used in the Book Technic Revival by Adam Bryant Copyright 2025.
I started this in an attemp to learn how to use Python to control legacy lego computer devices like the Dacta interface B and Lego Mindstorms.

The Code contained withing can be very rough as its just what I get working at the time.
I won't be creating a library file of callable functions as I don't know how yet.
